# Contribution Guide

## Bug Reports

To encourage active collaboration, we strongly encourages pull requests,
not just bug reports. "Bug reports" may also be sent in the form of a pull
request containing a failing test.

However, if you file a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a
clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant
information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal
of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the
bug and develop a fix.

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem
will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug
report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it.
Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of
fixing the problem.
